# Python Imaging

In an effort to create some better imaging to view cells, ECM components and other things simultaneously, these scripts have been written.


## Scripts

* `basic_cell_plot.py`: create a plot with Cells plotted.
* `basic_oxygen_density.py`: Plot the density of oxygen.  

## ToDo
* Read in data
* ECM anisotropy plot
* ECM density plot
* ECM alignment plot
* Overlap all elements / modularity
* Panels
